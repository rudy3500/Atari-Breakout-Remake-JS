Modernized Atari Breakout Remake with Java Script

## Play Instructions
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle. <br />The goal is to break all the bricks on the screen using the ball. 
Once all the bricks break the board will reset; you have 5 lives to achieve the highest score that you can!<br />
If the ball goes out of bounds hit 'r' to use your next life, once all your lives are spent the game is over and you will see your final score.<br />
Have Fun!
